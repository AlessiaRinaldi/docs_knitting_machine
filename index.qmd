## From a Digital Design to Fabric


::: {.columns .v-center}
::: {.column width="50%"}

The idea behind this project draws inspiration from the operating principle of **3D printers**: starting from a digital model, they can automatically produce objects with **precision** and **repeatability**.

The objective of this work is to bring the same paradigm to textiles, by developing an **automated knitting machine** capable of producing knit patterns from a predefined digital design.
