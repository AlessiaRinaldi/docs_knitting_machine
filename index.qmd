title: "Automated Knitting Machine"
---
The idea behind this project draws inspiration from the operating principle of 3D printers: starting from a digital model, they can automatically produce three-dimensional objects with precision and repeatability.

The objective of this project is to transpose this paradigm to the textile field by developing an automated knitting machine capable of producing knit patterns from a predefined digital design.
