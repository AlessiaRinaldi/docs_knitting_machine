## Conclusions and Future Work

This work presented a complete real-time vision system for hook-level error detection on an automated crochet machine, implemented on a Raspberry Pi 3 using a lightweight LLR-based classifier.

The system achieves high accuracy with an operating point tending toward zero false alarms, reaching approximately **97.4% accuracy** and **85% detection probability** on a test set of 771 images.

Future work will investigate:

- multi-frame decision fusion,

- learned feature representations (e.g., lightweight CNNs),

- improved mechanical stability and camera alignment.

Overall, the results demonstrate that **low-cost embedded vision** can support reliable, real-time quality control on textile machines, with promising extensions toward more robust and general solutions.
