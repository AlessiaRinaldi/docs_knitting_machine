## Mechanical Design of the Camera Mount {#sec:camera_mount}

The camera mounting solution combines a commercially available __magnetic-base stand_ with a __custom 3D-printed support__ designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi Camera module.  
The magnetic base provides a __rigid__ and __highly stable foundation__, while allowing fine manual adjustment in height, angle, and lateral position through its articulated arm.

### Custom 3D-Printed Camera Holder

A custom holder for the Raspberry Pi Camera v2.1 was designed in __Autodesk Fusion 360__ and fabricated using fused deposition modeling (FDM) with __PLA filament__ on a __Bambu Lab A1 Mini 3D printer__.  
The printed part encloses the camera PCB and incorporates a series of mounting holes and a pin that fits into the threaded end of the magnetic base arm.

### Stability Considerations and Limitations

While the magnetic stand and the 3D-printed camera holder provide sufficient __stability__ for prototyping, the overall __stiffness__ of the structure is __not optimal yet__.  
Small shifts caused by machine __vibration__ or accidental contact can slightly __alter the camera pose__ over time, affecting the exact position of the __region of interest__ in the image.  
Improving the mechanical stability of the mounting solution is therefore an __important direction__ for future work, with the goal of achieving __fully repeatable alignment__ over long acquisition periods.

A __CAD rendering__ of the printed holder is shown in Figure.
