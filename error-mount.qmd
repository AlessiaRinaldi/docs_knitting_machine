## Mechanical Design of the Camera Mount {#sec:camera_mount}

The camera mounting solution combines a commercially available magnetic-base stand with a custom 3D-printed support designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi Camera module.  
The magnetic base provides a rigid and highly stable foundation, while allowing fine manual adjustment in height, angle, and lateral position through its articulated arm.

A custom holder for the Raspberry Pi Camera v2.1 was designed in Autodesk Fusion 360 and fabricated using fused deposition modeling (FDM) with PLA filament on a Bambu Lab A1 Mini 3D printer.  
The printed part encloses the camera PCB and incorporates a series of mounting holes and a pin that fits into the threaded end of the magnetic base arm.

While the magnetic stand and the 3D-printed camera holder provide sufficient stability for prototyping, the overall stiffness of the structure is not optimal yet.  
Small shifts caused by machine vibration or accidental contact can slightly alter the camera pose over time, affecting the exact position of the region of interest in the image.  
Improving the mechanical stability of the mounting solution is therefore an important direction for future work, with the goal of achieving fully repeatable alignment over long acquisition periods.

A CAD rendering of the printed holder is shown in Figure.
