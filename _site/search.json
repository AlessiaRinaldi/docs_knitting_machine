    "text": "Textile practices such as crochet and knitting have recently experienced a widespread resurgence. Many creative activities traditionally rooted in manual craftsmanship, once considered less relevant in the context of industrialization and globalization, are now being rediscovered. Skills that historically required years of hands-on experience can, however, be difficult and discouraging for beginners, especially for adults who approach these practices with limited time, resources, or access to expert guidance. Crochet is a notable example: although widely practiced across cultures and historically spread in Europe through Italian convents in the sixteenth century, it remains technically demanding and highly dependent on the maker’s ability to recognize and correct errors. The COVID-19 pandemic further contributed to this renewed interest, encouraging many people to explore slow, creative, and tactile activities.\n\n\nDespite this revival, crochet performed using mechanical devices has seen relatively little technological development. Existing crochet machines remain strongly operator-dependent and offer limited support for automated quality monitoring. Moreover, hobbyist tools such as circular crochet looms, widely available and inexpensive, provide no error feedback and require constant attention from the user. In this work, we start from a commercially available circular loom intended for hobby use and, through a series of mechanical, electronic, and software modifications, transform it into a fully automated crochet machine capable of self-monitoring. This approach demonstrates how accessible off-the-shelf tools can be augmented and repurposed into automated systems, lowering the barrier to entry for creative technologies.\n\n\n\nA single undetected defect, such as missing yarn, incomplete engagement, or a misaligned loop, may propagate across many subsequent cycles, compromising the entire production and resulting in wasted time and materials. For hobbyists and individual makers, this leads to frustration and loss of work. For small and medium-sized factories, the consequences extend to production inefficiencies and environmental impact. As the textile industry is one of the major contributors to global waste and pollution, improving error detection and reducing material waste is a relevant challenge from both practical and sustainability perspectives.\n\n\n\nAutomating the early detection of such defects requires monitoring the hook at the precise moment when the yarn configuration becomes informative. In the scenario addressed in this work, a correctly formed stitch appears as a characteristic “U”-shaped engagement around the base of the hook. Any deviation from this expected pattern must be identified promptly to prevent the defect from propagating downstream.\n\n\n\nIn this section, we present a lightweight, real-time embedded vision system for hook-level error detection implemented entirely on a Raspberry Pi 3 equipped with a CSI camera module and mounted on a custom 3D-printed support.\nA hardware microswitch mounted on the machine provides a synchronization signal marking the exact phase of the hook movement, enabling image acquisition at each cycle for real-time inspection.\nIn this way system captures images in synchrony with the machine’s motion, isolates the region of interest, and analyzes it using a dedicated detection algorithm capable of distinguishing correct yarn engagement from error conditions.\nOur goal is to support both individual makers, who may not have access to industrial-grade equipment, and future industrial applications, where inline quality monitoring could significantly reduce waste and promote more sustainable textile manufacturing."

    "text": "The acquisition system plays a central role in the proposed error detection pipeline, as it must provide close-up images of the hook region at every relevant movement of the crochet machine.\nIn this work, we start from a commercially available circular crochet loom intended for hobby use and adapt it into an automated system through a set of mechanical and electronic modifications.\nThis choice allows us to preserve the low-cost and accessible nature of the original tool while enabling precise synchronization and repeatable inspection of each hook.\n\n\n\nOverview of the circular crochet loom.\n\n\nA hardware microswitch mounted on the modified loom generates a synchronization signal that marks the exact moment in the hook’s motion when the yarn configuration becomes informative.\nThis signal is used by the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ to trigger image acquisition in real time.\nAt each trigger, the system inspects the hook to verify that the yarn—regardless of its color, thickness, or texture—assumes the expected “U”-shaped configuration around the base of the hook.\nAny configuration that does not match this pattern is classified as an error.\nWhen an anomaly is detected, the system immediately stops the motor driving the process and displays a diagnostic message indicating the index of the affected hook.\nAn example close-up of the inspected region is reported in these two figures.\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of correct and defective yarn configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary objective of the acquisition system is to enable automatic, hook-level monitoring of the knitting process on a low-cost embedded platform.\nTo meet this goal, the choice of camera and interface must satisfy the following requirements:\n\nCompatibility with Raspberry Pi 3: use of natively supported interfaces and libraries.\nEase of software integration: availability of well-established computer vision libraries (e.g., libcamera, Picamera2, OpenCV).\nCost-effectiveness: sufficient resolution to distinguish fine yarn details while keeping costs low.\nClose-focus capability: ability to capture sharp images at short distances near the hook area.\nLow power consumption: efficient power usage to minimize the overall system load.\n\nThese requirements guided the evaluation of several acquisition architectures for the Raspberry Pi 3, considering their impact on image quality, latency, software complexity, and mechanical integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Raspberry Pi Camera v2.1 connects directly to the Broadcom SoC through the MIPI–CSI interface, a high-speed differential serial bus dedicated to video capture.\nThis direct link offers several advantages for the considered application:\n\nHigh bandwidth and low latency: the pixel stream reaches the processor without traversing the USB or network stack, resulting in reduced jitter and more deterministic timing.\nImage quality and control: the 8 MP sensor, combined with the Raspberry platform’s integrated image signal processor (ISP), provides fine control over exposure, gain, white balance, and frame rate.\nNative integration: the camera is supported via libcamera / Picamera2 and V4L2, with stable pipelines toward OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite, and other vision frameworks.\n\nIn the context of hook-level defect detection, these properties translate into a favorable signal-to-noise ratio and consistent frame characteristics, which are beneficial for detecting subtle differences in yarn configuration.\nThe low and predictable latency also facilitates accurate synchronization between the microswitch event and the captured image, which is critical for reliable inspection.\n\n\n\n\nThe ESP32-CAM module integrates an OV2640 sensor (2 MP) and a microcontroller with on-board Wi-Fi connectivity.\nIn a typical setup, images are captured on the ESP32-CAM and transmitted to the Raspberry Pi for processing, either via Wi-Fi or over a serial link:\n\nWi-Fi: the module sends JPEG or MJPEG frames to a broker or server.\nWiring is simple, but latency and jitter depend on network conditions, buffering, and retransmissions.\nSerial / USB–UART: the module transmits image data in chunks to the Raspberry Pi through a UART–USB bridge.\nThis reduces dependence on the wireless network, but requires application-level protocols for fragmentation, reassembly, and buffering.\n\nThe ESP32-CAM is extremely low cost and can operate as a stand-alone node.\nHowever, compared to a CSI-connected Pi Camera, it provides lower image quality and less precise control over acquisition parameters.\nOn-board compression may obscure fine textile defects, and the less deterministic timing makes it harder to align the acquisition instant with the hook motion.\nFrom a mechanical standpoint, the ESP32-CAM module is also bulkier than the Pi Camera, complicating its integration into the compact 3D-printed frame of the desktop crochet machine.\nOn the positive side, its shorter minimum focus distance can be advantageous for very close-up shots, potentially reducing the need for additional optics.\n\n\n\nIn preliminary experiments with a direct USB–UART connection, the ESP32-CAM was successfully flashed with a MicroPython firmware.\nHowever, upon reboot, the board remained stuck in the bootloader, and the serial output consisted only of unreadable characters or repetitive error messages, never reaching a stable REPL prompt.\nThis behavior prevented the validation of a reliable point-to-point communication channel with the Raspberry Pi and hindered further development of the serial-based approach.\n\n\n\n\nA Wi-Fi-based architecture was also evaluated, in which the ESP32-CAM periodically captured JPEG snapshots and published them to an MQTT topic, while the Raspberry Pi—running a Mosquitto broker—subscribed to the topic, decoded the images, and displayed or stored them locally.\nDespite its conceptual simplicity, this approach suffered from practical issues related to the transmission and reconstruction of the JPEG payloads.\nDecoding errors and corrupted frames frequently occurred, making it impossible to guarantee consistent image delivery for real-time detection.\nGiven these early difficulties and following an iterative, prototype-driven development process, the ESP32-CAM solutions were deemed insufficiently reliable for the timing and robustness requirements of hook-level error detection, and effort was redirected toward more tightly integrated alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard USB webcams offer a ready-to-use and widely available solution, typically with UVC support under Linux.\nHowever, image data must traverse the USB stack, introducing additional overhead compared to CSI and limiting the level of low-level camera control.\nSuch devices are suitable for early prototyping or applications with less stringent latency requirements, but are less attractive when deterministic timing and compact integration are needed.\n\n\n\nThe Raspberry Pi HQ Camera is a 12 MP module with a C/CS mount for interchangeable lenses.\nIt provides superior optical quality and flexibility in terms of focus, focal length, and macro optics, at the cost of higher price and significantly larger size compared to the Pi Camera v2.1.\nThe HQ Camera is therefore more appropriate when extreme close-ups or professional optical control are required, whereas the present work prioritizes low cost and compactness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the functional requirements, the practical experiments with the ESP32-CAM, and the constraints of the crochet machine, the Pi Camera v2.1 connected via the MIPI–CSI interface emerged as the most suitable option.\nIt combines sufficient resolution and close-focus capability with low and deterministic latency, strong software support on the Raspberry Pi 3, and a compact form factor compatible with the 3D-printed camera mount described in Section @sec:camera_mount.\nThis configuration is therefore adopted as the reference acquisition system for the error detection pipeline."

This prevented validation of direct communication with the Raspberry Pi.\n\n\nMQTT Variant Experiment (unsuccessful)\nWithin the Wi-Fi setup, a connection from ESP32-CAM → Raspberry Pi was attempted via an MQTT broker, following a snapshot-based approach:\n\nThe ESP32-CAM captures a JPEG frame every few seconds and publishes it to an MQTT topic.\n\nThe Raspberry Pi, running a Mosquitto broker, subscribes to the topic, decodes the images, and displays/saves them locally.\n\nDespite the theoretical simplicity of this architecture, the practical tests were unsuccessful.\nIn particular, transmission and decoding issues occurred with the JPEG payloads (published directly via MQTT), making it impossible to correctly reconstruct the images on the Raspberry Pi side.\nGiven these early failures and adopting an agile development approach (iterative and adaptive, as opposed to a waterfall model), the decision was made not to continue integrating the ESP32-CAM through this method, favoring more reliable solutions consistent with the project requirements.\nConclusion: the ESP32-CAM via MQTT approach proved too unreliable for real-time error detection, further reinforcing the preference for the Pi Camera connected via CSI.\n\n\n\n\nOther Considered Alternatives (not tested)\n\nUSB Webcam\nA ready-to-use and widely available solution with UVC support.\nHowever, the data path goes through the USB stack, adding overhead compared to CSI and limiting camera control.\nIt can be suitable for prototyping or when latency requirements are less strict.\n\n\nRaspberry Pi HQ Camera\nA 12 MP module with a C/CS mount for interchangeable lenses.\nIt offers superior optical quality and flexibility (focus adjustment, focal lengths, dedicated macro optics) at the cost of higher price and larger size. Recommended when extreme close-ups or professional optical control are required."

    "text": "The acquisition system plays a central role in the proposed error detection pipeline, as it must provide close-up images of the hook region at every relevant movement of the crochet machine.\nIn this work, we start from a commercially available circular crochet loom intended for hobby use and adapt it into an automated system through a set of mechanical and electronic modifications.\nThis choice allows us to preserve the low-cost and accessible nature of the original tool while enabling precise synchronization and repeatable inspection of each hook.\n\n\n\nOverview of the circular crochet loom.\n\n\nA hardware microswitch mounted on the modified loom generates a synchronization signal that marks the exact moment in the hook’s motion when the yarn configuration becomes informative.\nThis signal is used by the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ to trigger image acquisition in real time.\nAt each trigger, the system inspects the hook to verify that the yarn—regardless of its color, thickness, or texture—assumes the expected “U”-shaped configuration around the base of the hook.\nAny configuration that does not match this pattern is classified as an error.\nWhen an anomaly is detected, the system immediately stops the motor driving the process and displays a diagnostic message indicating the index of the affected hook.\nAn example close-up of the inspected region is reported in these two figures.\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of correct and defective yarn configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary objective of the acquisition system is to enable automatic, hook-level monitoring of the knitting process on a low-cost embedded platform.\nTo meet this goal, the choice of camera and interface must satisfy the following requirements:\n\nCompatibility with Raspberry Pi 3: use of natively supported interfaces and libraries.\nEase of software integration: availability of well-established computer vision libraries (e.g., libcamera, Picamera2, OpenCV).\nCost-effectiveness: sufficient resolution to distinguish fine yarn details while keeping costs low.\nClose-focus capability: ability to capture sharp images at short distances near the hook area.\nLow power consumption: efficient power usage to minimize the overall system load.\n\nThese requirements guided the evaluation of several acquisition architectures for the Raspberry Pi 3, considering their impact on image quality, latency, software complexity, and mechanical integration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Raspberry Pi Camera v2.1 connects directly to the Broadcom SoC through the MIPI–CSI interface, a high-speed differential serial bus dedicated to video capture.\nThis direct link offers several advantages for the considered application:\n\nHigh bandwidth and low latency: the pixel stream reaches the processor without traversing the USB or network stack, resulting in reduced jitter and more deterministic timing.\nImage quality and control: the 8 MP sensor, combined with the Raspberry platform’s integrated image signal processor (ISP), provides fine control over exposure, gain, white balance, and frame rate.\nNative integration: the camera is supported via libcamera / Picamera2 and V4L2, with stable pipelines toward OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite, and other vision frameworks.\n\nIn the context of hook-level defect detection, these properties translate into a favorable signal-to-noise ratio and consistent frame characteristics, which are beneficial for detecting subtle differences in yarn configuration.\nThe low and predictable latency also facilitates accurate synchronization between the microswitch event and the captured image, which is critical for reliable inspection.\n\n\n\n\nThe ESP32-CAM module integrates an OV2640 sensor (2 MP) and a microcontroller with on-board Wi-Fi connectivity.\nIn a typical setup, images are captured on the ESP32-CAM and transmitted to the Raspberry Pi for processing, either via Wi-Fi or over a serial link:\n\nWi-Fi: the module sends JPEG or MJPEG frames to a broker or server.\nWiring is simple, but latency and jitter depend on network conditions, buffering, and retransmissions.\nSerial / USB–UART: the module transmits image data in chunks to the Raspberry Pi through a UART–USB bridge.\nThis reduces dependence on the wireless network, but requires application-level protocols for fragmentation, reassembly, and buffering.\n\nThe ESP32-CAM is extremely low cost and can operate as a stand-alone node.\nHowever, compared to a CSI-connected Pi Camera, it provides lower image quality and less precise control over acquisition parameters.\nOn-board compression may obscure fine textile defects, and the less deterministic timing makes it harder to align the acquisition instant with the hook motion.\nFrom a mechanical standpoint, the ESP32-CAM module is also bulkier than the Pi Camera, complicating its integration into the compact 3D-printed frame of the desktop crochet machine.\nOn the positive side, its shorter minimum focus distance can be advantageous for very close-up shots, potentially reducing the need for additional optics.\n\n\n\nIn preliminary experiments with a direct USB–UART connection, the ESP32-CAM was successfully flashed with a MicroPython firmware.\nHowever, upon reboot, the board remained stuck in the bootloader, and the serial output consisted only of unreadable characters or repetitive error messages, never reaching a stable REPL prompt.\nThis behavior prevented the validation of a reliable point-to-point communication channel with the Raspberry Pi and hindered further development of the serial-based approach.\n\n\n\n\nA Wi-Fi-based architecture was also evaluated, in which the ESP32-CAM periodically captured JPEG snapshots and published them to an MQTT topic, while the Raspberry Pi—running a Mosquitto broker—subscribed to the topic, decoded the images, and displayed or stored them locally.\nDespite its conceptual simplicity, this approach suffered from practical issues related to the transmission and reconstruction of the JPEG payloads.\nDecoding errors and corrupted frames frequently occurred, making it impossible to guarantee consistent image delivery for real-time detection.\nGiven these early difficulties and following an iterative, prototype-driven development process, the ESP32-CAM solutions were deemed insufficiently reliable for the timing and robustness requirements of hook-level error detection, and effort was redirected toward more tightly integrated alternatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard USB webcams offer a ready-to-use and widely available solution, typically with UVC support under Linux.\nHowever, image data must traverse the USB stack, introducing additional overhead compared to CSI and limiting the level of low-level camera control.\nSuch devices are suitable for early prototyping or applications with less stringent latency requirements, but are less attractive when deterministic timing and compact integration are needed.\n\n\n\nThe Raspberry Pi HQ Camera is a 12 MP module with a C/CS mount for interchangeable lenses.\nIt provides superior optical quality and flexibility in terms of focus, focal length, and macro optics, at the cost of higher price and significantly larger size compared to the Pi Camera v2.1.\nThe HQ Camera is therefore more appropriate when extreme close-ups or professional optical control are required, whereas the present work prioritizes low cost and compactness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the functional requirements, the practical experiments with the ESP32-CAM, and the constraints of the crochet machine, the Pi Camera v2.1 connected via the MIPI–CSI interface emerged as the most suitable option.\nIt combines sufficient resolution and close-focus capability with low and deterministic latency, strong software support on the Raspberry Pi 3, and a compact form factor compatible with the 3D-printed camera mount described in Section @sec:camera_mount.\nThis configuration is therefore adopted as the reference acquisition system for the error detection pipeline."
